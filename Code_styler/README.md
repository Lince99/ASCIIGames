**THIS SOFTWARE IS ONLY AN UTILITY TOOL USED BY MYSELF
FOR HELPING FRIENDS WITH THEIR CODE,
BUT WITH AN ADAPTATION OF THEIR OWN CODE "STANDARDIZED" STYLE**

Code styler uses 3 different programs:
- cleaner: follow the xml rules to modify the source target
- checker: test if the source target follow it's xml language rules
- ruler: modify the xml rules and print an example (editable too)

TODO:
    simply THE CODE
