# RainboWhyNot
Why not?

## Usage

```bash
./rainbooows n_row n_width sleep
```

Where:
* n_row stands for number of rows used before side-change
* n_width stands for number of characters used by each color
* sleep stands how much seconds is used to slow down the speed of light

Example:
```bash
./rainbooows 50 5 40
```
It will print a funny rainbow with 50 rows before changing side, with every row print 5 char with the same color, then wait 40 ms for the next row
